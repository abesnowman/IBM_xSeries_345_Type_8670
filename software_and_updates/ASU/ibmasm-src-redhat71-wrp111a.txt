1.0  Overview
-------------
     This README.TXT file is associated with the following 2 RPM files:
     
     - ibmasm-src-suse72-WRPxxxA.rpm  
     - ibmasm-src-redhat71-WRPxxxA.rpm
	
	where xxx is the version of the source rpm that you are installing.
     
     These RPM files will build and install Linux device drivers 
     for the following IBM hardware:
     
     - Advanced System Management PCI Adapter card and its associated
       Shared Serial Port.	
     - Advanced System Management Processor, which is part of the 
       planar board on specific models of Netfinity and IBM eServer 
       xSeries servers
     - Automatic Server Restart (ASR) which is built onto the 
       planar board of specific models of xSeries servers
     - Remote Supervisor Adapter, which is an option on specific models
       of xSeries servers
     
     Supported Linux distribution(s):
     
     1) Red Hat, version 7.1
        - Specific kernel versions tested
          2.4.2-2
	  2.4.2-2smp
         
     2) SuSE, version 7.2
        - Specific kernel versions tested
          2.4.2-4GB
	  2.4.2-64GB-SMP

     3) Red Hat, version 6.2

          2.2.14-5
         

2.0  Change History
-------------------

     2.1  Added kernel configuration section.

     2.2  RPMs now support Red Hat 7.1 and SuSE 7.2 in source form only.

     2.3  Modified ibmasm-src to simply create a binary RPM, and not install
          any drivers. Also releasing an offical binary RPM that supports RedHat 7.0
          only.

     2.4  Modified normal command timeout to 45 seconds, instead of 240 seconds.
          Renamed package to ibmasm-src, in anticipation of releasing binary RPM
          packages as ibmasm.
          
     2.5  First release of shared serial driver included. Now detects SPWEB-PWS.
          Added ASR test functionality.
     
3.0  System Management Device Driver Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------
     
     NOTE:  The system that the source rpm file is to be run on must have 
            Linux development/build capability with the Linux kernel source
            installed and properly configured for your hardware.  See section
             4.0 for specifics.
 
     The source rpm file (ibmasm-src-[redhat/suse]) contains the open source 
     code for the IBM Advanced System Management device drivers for Linux. 
     The file is designed for installation using the Red Hat RPM "build" 
     system.  Executing the RPM utility against ibmasm-src-[redhat/suse] the 
     first time will build Linux drivers that are customized for the Linux 
     kernel version of the machine running the RPM utility.  This does not 
     install any drivers on the build machine, it merely generates a second 
     rpm file that can be installed on any machine running the same Linux 
     kernel and having the same hardware configuration.  Therefore, the 
     following steps must be executed in order to install the Linux Advanced 
     System Management drivers.
     
     
               NOTE: If this is an upgrade to an existing Advanced System 
                     Management driver, then the previously installed driver
                     packages must first be removed.  Depending upon your
		     system's configuration, you may see messages about
		     missing files when running the "rpm -e" commands. You
		     may safely ignore those messages.  Type the following two
                     commands at a shell prompt to remove the old driver source
                     and binaries:

               rpm -e ibmasm
     
               rpm -e ibmasm-src-[redhat71/suse72]
          
          
     To install the source rpm for SuSE version 7.2,
     execute the following command:
          
	rpm -ivh ibmasm-src-suse72-WRPxxxA.rpm

     where xxx is the version of the source RPM that you are installing.

     To install the source rpm for Redhat version 7.1,
     execute the following command: 
          
	rpm -ivh ibmasm-src-redhat71-WRPxxxA.rpm

     where xxx is the version of the source RPM that you are installing.
        
     To install the source rpm for Redhat version 6.2,
     execute the following commands: 
          
	ln -s /usr/src/linux /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build
	rpm -ivh ibmasm-src-redhat71-WRPxxxA.rpm

     where xxx is the version of the source RPM that you are installing.
        
     The above RPMs will create a binary rpm in the /usr/local/ibmasm
     directory that must be used to install the device driver.  

     To install the binaries, execute the following commands:
          
	cd /usr/src/ibmasm
	ls -l ibmasm*.rpm (to see the version number)
	rpm -ivh ibmasm-1.0-y.y.i386.rpm

        where y.y is the version of the binary RPM that you are installing.

     This RPM will create /usr/local/ibmasm/ibmasm.tgz, uncompress and
     untar the archive in the same location, copy the drivers, shared
     library, and all configuration files to their appropriate locations,
     clean up (remove files that are no longer required) and load the
     device drivers.

     The drivers will be configured to start at boot-time, and to stop at
     reboot or shutdown.

     There are two useful utility programs installed by the RPM.

	ibmspup is a small script that loads ibmasm.o (the service
	processor device driver) and ibmser.o (the shared serial port
	driver).  The ibmspup script creates /dev/ibmasm which is the 
        device file for the Advanced System Management hardware and
        /dev/ibmser which allows the Shared Serial Port featured on the
        ASM PCI card to be used by communication programs such as minicom.

        Note that these modules will not load if you do not have the 
        supported hardware installed.

	ibmspdown unloads the modules.

     You must have root priveledges to run these utilities.	    

As noted above,to uninstall, execute the following commands:

          rpm -e ibmasm

          rpm -e ibmasm-src-[redhat71/suse72]

          RPM will unload the drivers, and remove all ibmasm-related files
          from your system.

          It is recommended that you uninstall the drivers with -e before
          installing a new version, rather than upgrading with RPM's
          upgrade (-U) switch.

     
4.0 Kernel Configuration Notes
------------------------------

    Note:  You will not normally need to configure the kernel sources if
    you installed them during your initial Linux installation.

    To ensure that you have the correct kernel sources installed, you may
    need to execute the following commands, according to the distribution 
    that you're running.

     For Red Hat 7.1:

       rpm -qa | grep kernel

       Sample result (NOTE: Results will vary with different kernel versions):
       kernel-headers-2.4.2-2
       kernel-source-2.4.2-2
       kernel-smp-2.4.2-2
       kernel-2.4.2-2

       Make sure that kernel-headers and kernel-source rpm packages are present
       and that they match your kernel version number.

       Once you have the appropriate kernel sources installed you will need
       to configure them.  Execute the following commands:

       cd /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build

       make mrproper

       Execute one of the following commands based on your hardware
       configuration (again, the exact file names may vary):
	
	       cp -f configs/kernel-2.4.2-i586.config arch/i386/defconfig
	       cp -f configs/kernel-2.4.2-i586-smp.config arch/i386/defconfig
	       cp -f configs/kernel-2.4.2-i686-enterprise.config arch/i386/defconfig
      
       make oldconfig

       make dep

	
     For SuSE 7.2: 

       rpm -qa | grep kernel

       Sample result (NOTE: Results will vary with different kernel versions):
       kernel-source-2.4.4-SuSE17

       SuSE is configured with the Yast tool.  Use it install the appropriate
       kernel source files.  After installation configure the kernel sources
       by executing the following commands:

       cd /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build

       make mrproper

       cp -f /boot/vmlinuz.version.h /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/version.h	
       cp -f /boot/vmlinuz.config /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/.config	

       make cloneconfig

       make dep
