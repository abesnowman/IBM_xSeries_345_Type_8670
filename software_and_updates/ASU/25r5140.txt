       3.0   Installation and Setup Instructions
       
             The procedure to install the BIOS definition file for use with 
             IBM Advanced Settings Utility is as follows:
       
             3.1  Copy the .exe to a directory on the hard drive.
       
             3.2  Extract the .def from the .exe:
             
                  3.2.1  For Windows, double-click on the .exe or run it from
                         the command line.
                
                  3.2.2  For Linux, run "unzip <definition file>.exe" from the
                         command line, where <definition file>.exe is the 
                         downloaded file.

                  3.2.3  For DOS, run the .exe from the command line.

             3.3  Apply the .def to the asu executable:
                  
                  3.3.1  For Windows or DOS, run
                         "asu patchadd <definition file>.def" where
                         <definition file>.def is the extract .def.

                  3.3.3  For Linux, run
                         "./asu patchadd <definition file>.def" where
                         <definition file>.def is the extract .def.

       4.0   Configuration Information

       5.0   Unattended Mode
       
             All ASU operations are command line based and don't wait for user
             input.  As such, ASU can be scripted by using "batch" mode (see the
             Advanced Settings Utility User's Guide for more details) or any 
             scripting facility of your operating system.
