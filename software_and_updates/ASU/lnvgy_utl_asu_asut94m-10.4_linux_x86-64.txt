             2.2  Additional information.

             - UEFI-Compliant Systems
             
             The ASU 3.0 supports configuring settings in UEFI-compliant
             servers. 

             The IMM has both an external LAN connection and a USB device
             that supports LAN-over-USB (internal LAN connection).
             The protocol used over the internal and external LAN are the
             same, which allows ASU to be used remotely or locally. 

             ASU may also still communicate with the IMM locally via the
             KCS interface that was used on previous versions of ASU for
             BIOS-based Systems. 

             In order for the local connection to work properly, the USB
             device has to be configured.

             The LAN-over-USB (CDC Ethernet) device driver must be loaded
             and activated on the Operating System. In order to load the
             device driver for LAN-over-USB device, there must be no
             network device on the system configured with an IP adress of
             169.254.x.y other than the CDC Ethernet Device
             (the LAN-over-USB device).
             
             The file cdc_interface.sh is used to load a device driver
             for the CDC Ethernet Device. This file will be extracted along
             with asu in the same directory. 
             
             Note: In order for ASU to automatically load the driver, the
             cdc_interface.sh file must be placed in the same directory as asu.
             
             - BIOS-based Systems
             
             For ASU version 2.1 and greater, ASU supports
             certificate generation using RSA/RSAII commands.
             As part of the rsa command "generate" a xml
             file is needed as an argument for the generate command.
             The xml file contains information that is needed at
             the time of certificate generation.

             When the extraction is done a template.xml is
             provided in the same directory where this readme
             is placed.  In the template.xml, XXXX indicates
             fields where the user should imput the information
             for that particular item in the xml file. The items
             have min and max lengths which are defined in the xml file.
             If the item is defined as "Optional" and if it is
             not needed, the user should delete that item from
             the xml file before executing the generate command.

             The xml file supports the two types of RSA certificate
             generation: "Generate Self-Signed Certificate" and
             "Generate Certificate Signing Request (CSR)".
             Syntax of the asu commands are:

             ./asu64 generate RSA_Generate_SSL_Server_Certificate temp.xml
             ./asu64 generate RSA_Generate_SSL_Server_CSR temp.xml
             ./asu64 generate RSA_Generate_SSL_Client_Certificate temp.xml
             ./asu64 generate RSA_Generate_SSL_Client_CSR temp.xml


       3.0   Configuration Information

	     ASU 2.0(and higher) contains the RSA and BMC definition files(patches) already. 	
             Depending on the machine that you are running, BIOS CMOS definition
             file(patch) might also be present. To check what definition files(patches)
             are avaliable run "./asu64 patchlist". The patches that are
             available will be displayed.

             If the system does not have RSA, and the user issues any commands that would
             use the RSA an error message is presented to remove the RSA patch.  To remove
             the RSA patch, the user should execute "./asu64 patchlist" to determine which patch #
             corresponds to the RSA patch. Execute the asu command "./asu64 patchremove #",
             where # is the patch number that corresponds to the RSA patch. Similar
             if the system does not have a BMC, the user would do the same steps as
             was describe to remove the RSA patch.

             If a BIOS CMOS definition file(patch) is not present and the operator
             needs this definition file(patch), then the operator needs to add it.

             The steps to add the BIOS definition file(patch) to asu:

             3.1  Download/copy the definition file .exe to the same directory
                  on the hard drive to which asu.exe was extracted. The BIOS definition
                  file exe can be downloaded from the support download site for the
                  selected machine/model.

             3.2  Extract the definition file by running the exe at the command line.
		  This will place the "<definition file>.def" in the directory the exe is
		  executed from.

             3.3  Run "./asu64 patchadd <definition file>.def" where
                         <definition file>.def is the .def extracted from the
                         downloaded .exe.

       4.0   Unattended Mode

             All ASU operations are command line based and don't wait for user
             input.  As such, ASU can be scripted by using "batch" mode (see the
             Advanced Settings Utility User's Guide for more details) or any
             scripting facility of your operating system.

        7.0   Known Issue
 			 
             7.1  According to IMM mutinode design spec,Partition changes will fail 
                  if any of the systems specified in the change are powered on. These
                  changes include:
                      IMM.PartitionEnabled
                      IMM.PartitionNodes

                  There are 2 scenarios: 
                      1. For non-blade system, 
                          Poweroff the system, modify through out of band.
                      2. For blade system, 
                          Modify through AMM complex configuration.
                      
             7.2  IMM only supports one remote presence client connection.
                  If a remote presence console launched in web UI, RDCLI will fail.
                  Remote presence console must be closed when using RDCLI.

             
             7.3  Limitations on x3755 M3 type (7164):
                  1.  Settings are read-only:
                      BMC_User02LAN_Priv
                      BMC_User02Serial_Priv
                      BMC_User02Name
                      BMC_NetworkMACAddress
                  2.  Settings have dependence on other settings:
                      BMC_NetworkIPAddress
                      BMC_NetworkIPSubnetMask
                  These settings can be set when BMC_NetworkIPAddrSource is "Static Address"
                  3.  Settings need proper values
                      BMC_NetworkIPDefaultGateway
                      BMC_NetworkIPBackupGateway
                  Value of these settings must follow same pattern as BMC_NetworkIPAddress 
                  and BMC_NetworkIPSubnetMask
                  4.  Settings must wait for one second to take effective after config:
                      BMC_NetworkIPAddress
                      BMC_NetworkIPSubnetMask
                      BMC_NetworkIPDefaultGateway
                  5.  BMC_NetworkIPAddrSource only supports DHCP/Static Address/Other
                  6.  Can not Show/set BMC network related settings when the network port is in "shared" mode.

              7.4  Can not load default value for boot order          
                  Due to uEFI design limitations, currently ASU can not load default value for boot order, so
                  when you use loaddefault command for boot order, it does not change, still remains order before
                  the command is executed.

              7.5  Some uEFI settings can not be modified when run ASU on ESXi
                     uEFI.AdminPassword
                     PXE_CONFIGURATION.NicPortPxeMode
                     PXE_CONFIGURATION.NicPortPxeProtocol

                 A) To perform a mount:
                 rdmount {-s <sp> -d <path>} [-l <login> -p <password>] | -h -v
                 Note: 
                 -s (required) The ip address of the IMM (service processor) on the target machine
                 -d (required) The path on the client machine to the cd-rom or .iso file to mount
                 -l (optional) Userid on the IMM to perform authentication with (default is USERID)
                 -p (optional) Password on the IMM to perform authentication with (default is PASSW0RD)
                 -w (optional) Authentication port user want to communicate to SP
                 -h Display the command line help text
                 -v  Request verbose output.
										
                 B) To query an existing successful mounting record:
                     rdmount 每q
										
                 C) rdumount has a very simple interface as follows:
                     rdumount <token> | -h
                     Note: 
                     The ＆token＊ value is an unique id of an existing successful mounting
                     record on the client Operating System.
                     -h Display command line help text for the rdumount command.
             
                 
             8.6 Usage Example
             
                 A) To mount a CD-ROM in the /dev/cdrom drive or an .iso file to a target
                    system with an IMM ip address 192.168.0.1, using "USERID" as login id
                    and "PASSW0RD" as login password:
                     rdmount 每s 192.168.0.1 每d /dev/cdrom -l USERID 每p PASSW0RD
                     rdmount 每s 192.168.0.1 每d /home/install.iso -l USERID 每p PASSW0RD
                     rdmount 每s 192.168.0.1 每d /home/install.iso -l USERID 每p PASSW0RD -w 90

                 If remote IMM has an IPv6 address:
                     rdmount -s 2002:325b:1000::097D:5AF5 每d /dev/cdrom -l USERID -p PASSW0RD 
                     rdmount -s 2002:325b:1000::097D:5AF5 每d /home/install.iso -l USERID -p PASSW0RD
                     rdmount 每s 2002:325b:1000::097D:5AF5 每d /dev/cdrom -l USERID 每p PASSW0RD 每w 90
                     2002:325b:1000::097D:5AF5 is an IPv6 address of IMM.
                    
                 Result:
                     1. Success: Tell user mounting is successful.
                     2. Fail: Tell user the command operation is fail.
								 
                 B) To query for the existing mount information on the local client:
	                   rdmount -q

	               Result:
	                   1. Success: List all available mounting information on this client system,
	                      in the format:
	                           "Token 507: drive path /home/install.iso, mounted to SP 192.168.0.1,
	                           by user USERID"
                     2. Fail: Tell user the command operation is fail.

                 Note: 
                     "Token" is an unique id of an existing successful mounting record on the
                     client Operating System. You will not be able to know the mounting record
                     on another remote client system.
                 
                 C) To unmount a CD-ROM or .iso file with already known unique mounting record id 507:
                     rdumount 507
									
                 Result:
                     1. Success:  The mounting file will be unmounted from the remote IMM system.
                     2. Fail: Tell user the command operation is fail.
