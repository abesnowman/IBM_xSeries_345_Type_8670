1.0  Overview
-------------
     This README.TXT file is associated with the following RPM file:

     - ibmusbasm-1.18-2.src.rpm


     This RPM file will build and install the RSAII daemon and/or support
     software for the following IBM hardware:

     - IBM Remote Supervisor Adapter II

     
     Note 1: The ibmusbasm rpm requires the libusb and libusb-devel packages to be installed.  
     If your distribution does not include/install the 2 packages please reference Section
     4 for installation instructions.
     
     Note 2: If you have GCC compiler version 2.96, you should update it to version 3.xx.
    

2.0  Change History
-------------------
      - version 1.18
	  Added function to correctly identify the primary RSA II node in a 
          multi-node system.

      - version 1.17
          Issues fixed: Driver VPD did not report a 64-bit version when installed
          on x86_64/amd64 platforms;  On SLES 9, installation of this package broke
          the remote keyboard/mouse function of the RSAII adapter.
          Added auto-detection of the presence of RSAII adapter - installation exits if no RSAII
          
      - version 1.16
          Issue fixed: On some servers RSAII detection would not work properly at OS boot 
          time.  If that problem is detected, ibmasm will now restart itself.
          If libusb needs to be installed, we recommend installing the libusb source rpm
          instead of the binary rpm.  See section 4.2.        

      - version 1.15
          Issue fixed: when the reset happened, the daemon was still doing retries 
          that caused system error occurred

      - version 1.14
          Issue fixed: can't install the daemon when RPM version <= 4.04

      - version 1.13
      	  Issue fixed: no warning message when gcc library not being installed
      

      - version 1.12
          Issues fixed: the missing Buildlog file; warning message during installation on SLES9;
          no warning message when libusb-devel rpm not being installed.
     
      - version 1.11
          Fixed a return code value, CloseSPDriver now returns RC_INVALID_HANDLE
	  rather than RC_CLOSE_FAILED when invalid handle passed to it.

      - version 1.10
          Added Multi-node support to ibmasm.
          Added reset event support to ibmasm (5.2.16 event).
          Modified signal registration, now uses signal() instead
          of sigaction().
	  Modified ibmasm so that it links to libusb symbols dynamically.
	  Updated section 4 of this readme to correct a documentation
	  error for installiing libusb.

      - version 1.09
          Added Installation instructions to this readme for libusb
          and ibmusbasm on a Redhat system (see section 4.0).

      - version 1.08
          Added a delay when initializing the daemon after a
          Service Processor reset which allows the adapter to complete
          initalizing before the daemon loads.

      - version 1.07
	  Fixed a timing problem in RegisterForReverseHeartBeat.


3.0  RSAII daemon Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------------
     3.1  Supported versions:

          3.1.1) Red Hat, version 7.3

          3.1.2) SuSE8.0, SLES8 with service pack 3 or above
	
          3.1.3) SLES9
	
          3.1.4) Red Hat, Advanced Server version 2.1/3.0
	
     3.2  RSAII RPM installation:

          NOTE: Before installing the RSA II software, make sure the 
                mini USB cable is connected between the RSA II and a 
                USB port on the xSeries server.  Also make sure the 
                RSA II is configured for "Linux OS".  If either of 
                these steps is not performed then the RSA II software
                installation may fail.  Refer to the RSA II 
                Installation Guide and RSA II User's Guide for 
                additional information. 

	  To install the RPM execute the following commands:

            1:   rpmbuild --rebuild ibmusbasm-1.XX.src.rpm
            2:   cd /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i386 
                 ( For Redhat: cd /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 )
            3:   rpm -ivh ibmusbasm-1.XX.i386.rpm


          NOTE: If this is an upgrade to an existing RSAII
                daemon, then the previously installed
                packages must first be removed.  Depending upon your
                system's configuration, you may see messages about missing
                files when running the "rpm -e" commands.  You may safely
                ignore those messages.  Type the following two commands at
                a shell prompt to remove the old source and
                binaries:

                     rpm -e ibmusbasm

		  or for a Red Hat system possibly

                     rpm -e ibmasm
                     rpm -e ibmasm-src-redhat

		  or for a SuSE system possibly

                     rpm -e ibmasm
                     rpm -e ibmasm-src-suse

     3.3  Un-installing the ibmusbasm RPMS.

          To uninstall the binary rpm, execute the following command:

          rpm -e ibmusbasm

          RPM will unload the daemons, and remove all ibmasm-related files
          from your system.

          It is recommended that you uninstall the daemons with -e before
          installing a new version, rather than upgrading with RPM's
          upgrade (-U) switch.

     3.4  Utility Programs.

          There are two useful utility programs installed by the RPM.

          ibmspup is a small script that loads ibmasm (the service
          processor daemon).
          Note that these modules will not load if you do not have the
          supported hardware installed.

          ibmspdown unloads the modules.

          You must have root priveledges to run these utilities.


4.0  Installing libusb and libusb-devel
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
     4.1  Get/download version 0.1.6 (or later) of the libusb /libusb-devel 
     	  rpms (e.g. you might get them from RedHat Enterprise Linux
     	  Advanced Server 3.0 cds). 

          Note: On SLES9 the libusb-devel package has been combined with the
          the libusb package, so only the libusb package is required.
          
     4.2  We recommend installing the source rpm because this eliminates any
          incompatibilities that might be encountered between the binary libusb
          and older Linux kernels, like that on Red Hat Advanced Server 2.1.
          After downloading the source rpm (e.g. libusb-0.1.6-1.src.rpm), issue
          the following commands from the directory that the libusb rpm resides:

          4.2.1)  rpm --rebuild --nodeps libusb-0.1.6-1.src.rpm
          4.2.2)  cd /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386 (For Suse: cd /usr/src/packages/RPMS/i386)
          4.2.3)  rpm -ivh libusb-0.1.6-1.i386.rpm
          4.2.4)  rpm -ivh libusb-devel-0.1.6-1.i386.rpm
          4.2.5)  cd /usr/lib
          4.2.6)  ln -s libusb-0.1.so.4 libusb.so
          4.2.7)  ldconfig
