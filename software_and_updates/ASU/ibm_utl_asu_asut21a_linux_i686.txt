       2.0   Installation and Setup Instructions
       
             The procedure to install the Advanced Settings Utility for
             Linux is as follows:
      
             2.1  Copy the .tgz to a directory on the hard drive.
       
             2.2  Run "tar zxf <ASU distribution>.tgz" where 
                  <ASU distribution>.tgz is the downloaded .tgz.

       3.0   Configuration Information

             To enable support for viewing/changing settings on a BIOS level
             or for RSA/RSAII firmware, apply a definition file to asu.exe
             
             3.1  Copy one or more definition file .exes to the same directory
                  on the hard drive to which asu.exe was extracted.  Definition
                  files can be downloaded for BIOS or RSA/RSAII firmware from
                  the support download site.

             3.2  For each definition file:
             
                  3.2.1  Extract the definition file by running it from the
                         command line.

                  3.2.2  Run "./asu patchadd <definition file>.def" where
                         <definition file>.def is the .def extracted from the
                         downloaded .exe.

       4.0   Unattended Mode
       
             All ASU operations are command line based and don't wait for user
             input.  As such, ASU can be scripted by using "batch" mode (see the
             Advanced Settings Utility User's Guide for more details) or any 
             scripting facility of your operating system.
