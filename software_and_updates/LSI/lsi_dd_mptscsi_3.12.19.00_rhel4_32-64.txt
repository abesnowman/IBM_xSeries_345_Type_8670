2.1 Introduction

On a Linux system, loadable device drivers, or kernel modules, are highly dependent on the 
version of kernel that they support.  Generally, when a new kernel is made available by a Linux 
distribution, new kernel modules are provided at the same time to match this new kernel version.   
In some cases, there may be a need to use a device driver not provided by the distribution, 
either the hardware is not yet officially supported, or a specific version is needed.  In such 
cases, it is often the case that one needs to build new device drivers from source or be 
provided kernel modules that match one's kernel.  

This README is part of a tarball, also referred to as a FixID, which contains a set of device 
drivers (packaged as RPMs), along with some scripts and tools used to help install these RPM 
packaged device drivers.    


2.2 Requirements

You need to have Perl, rpm-build, and rpm-lib installed to use the installation script and its 
helper 'driver tool'. These are likely already installed, but if not, they can be found on the 
installation media for your Linux distribution.


2.3 Inside the FixID

At the top level of the FixID is an install.sh script. By default, running this script will 
install the latest version of ibm-driver-tools. It will then run the driver tool and determine 
whether or not to install the binary RPM included in the FixID into the currently running 
kernel.

The flavor of the kernel distinguishes a kernel by certain capabilities. For example, you can 
find uniprocessor, multiprocessor, and extended memory kernel flavors.  A kernel module must be 
built or provided for each flavor of kernel one wishes to run. 

If the driver tool determines that there is no driver already supplied by the OS vendor and that 
a version of the driver that is compatible with the current kernel version and flavor is present 
in the fixid, it will install the device driver.  By default, the driver tool will not install a 
new driver over a driver already provided by the OS vendor. However, one can override this 
behavior by manually passing options to the script. Additionally, there are options for 
targeting a kernel version or flavor besides the currently running one.

Also included in the FixID are source RPMs for building device driver RPMs. Building binary 
RPMs will target the currently running kernel version and flavor for 2.6 based OSs (i.e., RHEL4, 
SLES9 and SLES10). Inside the source RPM's .spec file are comments on how to target additional 
kernels.  2.4 based OSs require additional setup before binary RPMs can be built (documentation 
is included with the FixID).


2.4 How it all works

The Linux kernel exports an interface (kernel application binary interface, or kABI) for device 
drivers to use to communicate with the kernel.  If the interface changes, a newly recompiled 
version of the device driver will be necessary.  In a typical security update (and sometimes 
in a non-security update), these interfaces do not change. The ibm-driver-tool scripts analyze 
whether a change has occurred.  If no change has occurred, itwill generate a new RPM (using the 
old binary device drivers) specifically for the newer kernel, and install it. The resulting 
binary can be found in the filesystem wherever the specific OS vendor's RPM directories exist 
(Red Hat uses /usr/src/redhat/RPMS and SuSE uses /usr/src/packages).

The binary RPMs install their files into the '/updates' directory under the appropriate kernel 
module directory (i.e., /lib/modules/2.6.12-21.ELsmp/updates).

If the RPM is for a storage device driver, then the RPM will generate a new initrd (initial 
ramdisk) containing the new device driver, and will add a new entry into the GRUB boot menu 
which uses the new initrd. Uninstalling the RPM undoes these actions.


2.5 Naming conventions

The name of the binary RPMs contain the following fields:

<device manufacturer>-<device driver name>-<kernel flavor supported>-<device driver version>_
<kernel version compiled against>-<rpm release>.<architecture>.rpm

An example RPM for RHEL4 might be named 
'ibm-genericnetworkdriver-smp-1.0_2.6.12_31.EL-0.x86_64.rpm'.

This RPM name indicates that the RPM contains the 1.0 version of the device driver 
'genericnetworkdriver' compiled against the smp flavor of the 2.6.12-31.EL kernel for the x86_64 
architecture.


In the case where the kernel installed is different than that listed in the <kernel version 
compiled against> field, the resulting RPM will have the following naming format:

<device manufacturer>-<device driver name>_for_<kernel version installed to>-<kernel flavor 
supported>-<device driver version>_<kernel version compiled against>-<rpm 
release>.<architecture>.rpm

For example, the RPM name 'ibm-genericnetworkdriver_for_2.6.12_55.EL-smp-
1.0_2.6.12_31.EL-0.x86_64.rpm', reveals that the RPM contains the 1.0 version of the device 
driver for genericnetworkdriver compiled against the smp flavor of the 2.6.12-31.EL kernel (but 
installing for 2.6.12-55.EL) for the x86_64 architecture.


2.6 Typical usage


2.6.1 Installation

To use IBM's driver tools, you should unpackage the FixID into it's own directory and run
'./install.sh --update'.

This invokes the default behavior which installs the device driver if a compatible version (for 
the currently running kernel version and flavor) is included in the FixID and the OS vendor does 
not already provide a version of the driver.

If a compatible version is found in the fixid but the OS vendor already includes a version of 
the driver, the script will not install the device driver.  The OS version can be overridden 
by running './install.sh --update --override'.


2.6.2 Upgrading / downgrading

If you already have a device driver from another FixID installed, the scripts will perform 
version checking and stop if they detect that the currently installed version of the device 
driver is newer than what is in the FixID (i.e., you are trying to install an old FixID). This 
can be overridden by running './install.sh --update --force'.

Another way to accomplish the same result is to use the '--force-if-overridden' argument.  This 
will allow you to upgrade (or downgrade) only if the script detects that you've previously 
installed the driver from a FixID using the '--override' argument. Using '--force-if-overriden' 
preserves the default behavior of not overriding the device driver if it's included with the OS, 
but if the OS driver has already been overridden, then it will go ahead and install the device 
driver included in the FixID (assuming a kernel ABI compatible version of the device driver is 
included in the FixID).

In order to use upgraded device driver, reboot the server. 


2.6.3 Uninstalling

After successfully installing a device driver using IBM's driver tools, there will be a 
corresponding entry in the RPM database.

To querying the RPM database for 'genericnetworkdriver', run 

	'rpm -qa | grep genericnetworkdriver'

This should output something similar to

	'ibm-genericnetworkdriver_for_2.6.12_55.EL-smp-1.0_2.6.12_31.EL'

To remove the device driver, run

	'rpm -e ibm-genericnetworkdriver_for_2.6.12_55.EL-smp-1.0_2.6.12_31.EL'


6.4 Targeting other kernels

To target a kernel version or flavor besides the currently running one, run

	'./install.sh --update --kernel 2.6.12-21.EL --flavor hugemem'

Where --kernel is supplied in the format returned by running 'uname -r' on the OS in question 
minus the flavor information returned. In the case where a kernel flavor is empty (ie. 
2.6.12-21.EL as opposed to 2.6.12-21.ELsmp) 'default' is the flavor name to use.


2.7 IBM driver tool manpage

install.sh

NAME
	install.sh -- installs drivers contained in IBM's fixids

SYNOPSIS
	install.sh    --update [--force | --override | --force-if-overridden ] 
			[--kernel kernelversion] [--flavor kernelflavor] 
	install.sh    --query [ --kernel kernelversion ] 
					[ --flavor kernelflavor ]
	install.sh    --requires
	install.sh    --help
	install.sh    --help-help

DESCRIPTION

	install.sh --update mode determines the correct RPM provided 
	in the fixid and installs it if the RPM is built for the targeted 
	kernel.  If a RPM is unavailable for the targeted kernel than it 
	generates a RPM using the RPM built for the least previous kernel and 
	installs it. Note the new RPM is generated and installed only
	if the Application Binary Interface (ABI) used by the driver is 
	compatible with that provided
	by the target kernel.  The behavior of the tool also depends 
	on the availability of distribution supplied drivers in the kernel 
	and on the use of some of the command line options.  

	
	The following options can be used to tailor the behavior.

		  By default the driver in the RPM is installed 
                  if the distro driver, if present (by a previous
		  installation), is already
                  overridden and any installed non-distro driver
                  is older than this driver.  This ensures that
                  either the distro driver is used or the most
                  recent non-distro driver is used.

        --override  override the distro driver and installs this
                    driver if any installed non-distro driver is older
                    than this driver. This option ensures that the most
                    recent non-distro-driver is used.

        --force     installs the RPM containing the driver 
                    unconditionally.
                    This option ensures that the non-distro driver is used.

        --force-if-overridden
                    force-install the driver in the RPM only if the
                    distro driver is already overridden. This
                    option ensures that either the distro driver 
                    is used or this driver is used.

	--kernel    Use this flag to specify a kernel other than the
		    currently running one.  This should be in the 
		    format of a 'uname -r'.

	--flavor    Use this flag to specify a kernel flavor other than
		    the currently running one.  For uniprocessor kernels
		    the flavor is 'default' instead of ''.  For all other
		    flavors, there is no translation necessary.

	--query	    returns the version of the driver
		    already installed by the driver and the version of the driver that 
		    will be installed. Also it prints a message informing 
		    whether the driver is already installed by the distro,
		    and if it is a newer or a older version of the driver compared
		    to the one that will be installed.

	--update    The IBM driver tools will not perform any driver 
		    installs unless '--update' is passed as an
		    argument.

	--help	    describes all the modes and options.

	--help-help describes all of the modes and options, and reports 
		    all non-documented and non-supported options that 
		    should not be relied upon.

	--requires  returns the all the components that
		    the RPM depends on.

	NOTE: if no mode is specified the update mode is assumed.

	By default the current running kernel and flavor is the target.
	However --kernel option can be used to target a different kernel
	version and --flavor option can be used to target a different
	flavor.
		     
	NOTE: The RPMs supplied in the fixid have the following behavior. A new
	IBM specific kernel initial ramdisk is created and an entry for the current 
	kernel and the new initial ramdisk is placed in the GRUB boot menu (and set as 
	the default entry for subsequent boots).  The name of the new GRUB boot
	menu entry should be the same as the existing menu entry for the 
	kernel with the addition of '.update' appended.  The name of the 
	new ramdisk should be the same as the kernel's initial ramdisk with a 
	'.update' appended.  Multiple runs of the script will keep overwriting 
	the '.update' initial ramdisk and GRUB entry. 

Examples:

	The following will install for the specified kernel and 
	flavor (assuming a newer version of the driver is not 
	already installed for the target kernel/flavor combination):

		install.sh --kernel 2.6.9-35 --flavor hugemem

	To install for the specified kernel on the currently running 
	flavor (assuming a newer version of the driver is not already 
	installed for the target kernel/flavor combination):

		install.sh --kernel 2.6.9-35

	To install for the currently running kernel for the specified 
	flavor (assuming a newer version of the driver is not already 
	installed for the target kernel/flavor combination):

		install.sh --flavor largesmp

	To install for the current kernel and flavor regardless of the 
	version currently installed if the kABI is compatible:

		install.sh --force

RETURN CODES
	install.sh exits with 0 on success or non-zero if failure 
	in regular operation (ie. not using the --query option).

	install.sh with the --query option returns 0 if the version 
	presently installed and the version in the fixid are the same, 
	1 if the version in the fixid is newer or there is no currently 
	installed version of the driver, 2 if the version in the fixid 
	is older than the currently installed driver.

	4 : ABI FAILURE
	5 : if the rpm for the corresponding kernel is not packaged and the userhas indicated not to generate a new rpm.
	6 : RPM IS CORRUPT
	8 : generation of the new rpm failed (mostly because of unavailability of rpmbuild command)
	9 : UNSUPPORTED DISTRO
	10: UNDEFINED ARCHITECTURE
	11: NO USABLE RPM EXISTS
	12: RPM  has been generated incorrectly.
