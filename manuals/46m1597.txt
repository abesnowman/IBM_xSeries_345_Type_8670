1.0  ABOUT THIS README FILE
---------------------------

IBM ServerGuide reduces the complexity of server deployment by 
detecting installed options and providing device drivers. The 
ServerGuide wizard detects the server model and installed
adapters; then, the wizard guides you through setup,
configuration, and network operating system (NOS) installation.



2.0 CHANGE HISTORY
------------------

This section contains information about the ServerGuide change
history.

3.0  Remote Installs Support 
----------------------------

o  Remote Installs are supported using the Remote Supervisor
   Adapter II (RSA II), BladeCenter Management Module (MM), and
   BladeCenter Advanced Management Module (AMM).

o Remote Install Limitations: 
  o For MM only, the left button mouse function doesn't 
    work with a single click.  The workaround is to use double click to
    to do selections in ServerGuide graphical user interface.
  o The same CD/DVD Drive used for ServerGuide CD needs to be use
    for Windows CD/DVD.

o  Instructions for running ServerGuide via remote disk feature:

1  Install Java(TM) Plug-in and disable cache for Web Browser Java plug-in 
    to enable remote console to work.
2  Connect to the RSAII,MM,or AMM Web Management Interface (via Web browser) 
3  Click on Task "Remote Control"
4  Start Remote Control, it will open second Web Browser Window
5  Make sure the target System is Powered Off
6  Make sure the target System's CD/DVD drive is empty 
7  Mount the ServerGuide CD

5.0  LIMITATIONS
----------------
The following limitations are applicable to this version of IBM
ServerGuide:

o  When using ServerGuide in a multi-node server configuration, the 
   server summary report screen does not indicate a multi-node 
   configuration.  However, the number of processors reported will 
   be consistent with your hardware.
o  When using ServerGuide on an xSeries 460 two node configuration with
   a ServeRAID 8i adapter present in one node and not in the other, a 
   NMI error will occur.  The workaround is to boot the xSeries 460 as
   a single node, install the operating system with ServerGuide and
   then boot the configuration as multi-node.  
o  Using ServerGuide on an xSeries 460 two node configuration with a
   ServeRAID 8i adapter present in both nodes is not supported.  The 
   workaround is to start the ServerGuide setup in standalone mode by 
   pressing Esc to bypass partition merge during machine boot.  When 
   the Windows files are finished copying to the hard drive and the 
   ServerGuide setup is finished, then the system can be booted in
   multinode.
   NOTE:  During installation, ServerGuide may reboot the system in the
          middle of the setup process.  If the system reboots, press
          Esc to bypass the partition merge and boot standalone. 
          Repeat this step each time the system reboots until the 
          Windows files are copied to the hard drive.
o  ServerGuide does not support the use of the following IBM Ultra 320 
   Controller 2 adapter (13N2249, 39R8743, 43W4324, 43W4325).    
o  ServerGuide does not support installing to any USB storage device or running
   from a USB flash memory drive.  
o  When using a MegaRAID controller in System x3850 M2/System x3950 M2
   for the onboard drives, all RAID configurations need to deleted 
   before any attempt to use the LSI SAS 1078 onboard controller with
   the same onboard drives.
o  When installing to drives attached to an IBM iSCSI Server TX adapter
   (30R5201), you may not be able to create a 100 GB partition.  
   The workaroud is to create a partition of a different size (eg 110 GB).
o  On x3850 M2 and x3950M2, the Microsoft IPMI device driver is 
   required and is the only supported IPMI driver.  In Windows 2003, 
   the Microsoft IPMI device driver is only supported on Microsoft 
   Windows Server 2003 R2. 
 
   To install the Microsoft IPMI driver on an installation of Windows 
   Server 2003 R2:

   1. In Control Panel, select Add or Remove Programs.
   2. Select Add/Remove Windows Components.
   3. Select Management and Monitoring Tools and press 
      the Details button.
   4. Choose the Hardware Management option. 
   5. Press the OK button to select the Hardware Management 
      Component, and then press the Next button.
o  All iSCSI adapters require Windows 2003 SP1 or higher for the 
   driver to function properly.
o  All Fiber channel adapters require Windows 2003 SP2 or higher for the 
   driver to function properly.
o  When performing any Windows Server 2003 installs on System x3105,
   Service Pack 1 or higher is recommended.  Installs done without Service 
   Pack 1 will complete, but there will be two yellow warnings in the 
   Device Manager under 'Other Devices': 
     PCI Memory Controller 
     SM Bus Controller

   In order to fix these you must either:

   - Install Service Pack 1 or higher (recommended)

   OR

   - Run the driver package C:\drv\CSNX86\CSNX86.exe on your system and 
     follow the onscreen instructions, which will include installing 
     DirectX 9 from the Microsoft website
o  Partitioning screen appears to hang
   When using ServerGuide to partition disks of 300 GB or larger, the 
     partitioning may take 15-20 minutes for the process to complete.
o  RAID configuration for LSI-SAS adapters
   For LSI 1064/1064e/1078 SAS controllers or an IBM SAS HBA controller and 
     LSI 1020/1030 SCSI ServerGuide is unable to unable to remove any logical 
     volumes including RAID arrays on the adapters due to the limitation of 
     the adapters.
   To avoid any problems with RAID configuration, use the Ctrl+C menu 
     on system POST prior to using ServerGuide to remove all logical volumes.
o  Critical Error during RAID Configuration of adapter LSI 1078 SAS IR on 
   the x3850 M2/x3950 M2
   For the LSI 1078 SAS IR controller, the total number of disks in a 
     RAID array cannot exceed six.  To avoid any problems with RAID 
     configuration of the LSI 1078 SAS IR controller, reduce the number 
     of disks to six or select the RAID Defaults option of ServerGuide 
     instead a specific RAID level.
o  "No operating system found" during Windows 2003 or Windows 2008 installation
   When you perform a Windows installation, ServerGuide attempts to install 
     Windows to the first disk on the system presented by the diskpart command 
     line utility.
   Due to limitations of the system, when multiple storage adapters are 
     present on the system, the first disk presented by the diskpart utility 
     is not always the first disk on the system. 
   To avoid this problem, please remove any or all storage adapters 
     that are not required for the Windows installation.
o  Installing any Windows Server 2003 64-bit version with Service Pack 2 to 
   SATA drives connected to IBM SAS HBA on x3455 or performing Windows Server 
   2003 64-bit version with Service Pack 2 installation on x3655

   To install any Windows Server 2003 64-bit version with Service Pack 2 
   to SATA drive(s) connected to SAS HBA part number 25R8060 on a System x3455, 
   the planar SATA controller must be disabled in the BIOS. Likewise, to 
   install one of these Operating Systems on System x3655  the onboard SATA 
   controller must be disabled.  To do this:

   1. Boot into BIOS Setup by pressing F1
   2. Go into  the "Devices and I/O Ports" menu
   3. Set "Planar SATA" to disabled 
   4. Save your changes and exit

   After the OS is installed, you may reenable the SATA controller, but 
   in order for it to work you will need to install the drivers found in 
   the C:\drv\SATA directory.  

   Note: Installing an OS to external storage is not supported with this adapter.
o  Windows 2008 Japanese keyboard information:

   The Windows 2008 unattended install process does not properly set the 
   keyboard type to the Japanese (106/109 key) keyboard type, even if it 
   was selected in the Windows 2008 install screen.  

   To set the keyboard type to Japanese (106/109 key) keyboard in Windows 
   2008 after installation has completed, run C:\jpkbd106.reg and then 
   reboot the system.
o  When installing Windows 2003 with an IBM 10GbE PCIe SR Server Adapter 
   (P/N 42C1760) in the system, you may find a yellow bang in Device Manager 
   under "Other Device" for the "Ethernet Controller"

   To resolve this problem, 
   1)  Create an account at: 
       http://www.netxen.com/support/downloads/drivers_software.asp
   2)  Log into the account with the OEM  set to 'IBM'.
   3)  Once you have logged on, download the zip file containing the driver.
   4)  Unzip the driver package.
   5)  To install the driver, right click on the "Ethernet Controller" in 
       Device Manager and select "Update Driver..."
   6)  On the first screen of the wizard select "Install from a list or 
       specific location (Advanced)".
   7)  On the next screen click the checkbox "Include this location in the search:" 
       and use the browser button to navigate to the unzipped driver directory.
   8)  The correct subdirectory will either be win2k3\x64 or win2k3\x86 depending 
       on if you are running a 64-bit or 32-bit version of Windows respectively.
   9)  After you have selected the correct driver directory then continue to s
       elect next to navigate through the rest of the Hardware Update Wizard.
